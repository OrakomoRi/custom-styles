# Custom styles
### Made for some websites across the internet

Some websites are ugly or have a boring common look. It would be better if I could use custom styles...

<div align="center"><code align="center">/* WORK IS ALWAYS IN PROGRESS */</code></div>

---

### Usage

1. Chose the theme.
2. Remember its ```_theme-name_```.
3. Copy the content of the file ```_theme-name_-import.css```, then paste it into any browser extension that allows user CSS on websites.

### Structure of the main file

```css
@import url(''); /* Some needed imports */

/* Variables (values can be changed) */
:root {
	--var-name: none; /* Some variable | Each of them should theoretically have description */
}
```
